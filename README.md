Connection Reporter
=========================================
An Appcelerator Titanium Module

This is an Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Module for reporting Internet Connection Types, since Appcelerator Titanium only reports if the device is online or offline.

This module was created cause I needed to get the type of the connection the device was getting when a network change event if fired, so I could treat requests in a more specific way.
