Connection Reporter - Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Module
=========================================================

This is a module for reporting Internet Connection Types, since Appcelerator Titanium only reports if the device is online or offline.

This module was created cause I needed to get the type of the connection the device was getting when a network change event if fired, so I could treat requests in a more specific way.
